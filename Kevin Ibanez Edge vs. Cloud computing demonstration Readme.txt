Project Demonstration: Edge Computing Simulation

1. Introduction:
   This project simulates data processing in edge and cloud computing environments to compare latency.

2. Files:
   - edge_computing_simulation.py: Python script for the simulation.
   - latency_comparison_plot.png: Visualization of latency comparison.
   - simulation_output.txt: Sample output of the simulation.
   - project_report.pdf: Detailed report on the project.

3. Setup Instructions:
   - Install required libraries: pip install simpy networkx matplotlib
   - Run the simulation: python edge_computing_simulation.py
   - View the results in the generated plot and output files.
